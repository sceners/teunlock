 How to use it:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
simply start tEunlock.exe and click on the file u want to decrypt (isn't that simple :-)


 Features:
~~~~~~~~~~
-Kills the Telock section & almost rebuilds resource section
-Support for the following versions v0.41b, v0.41c and v0.42

 Known Problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-bug when unpacking loader32.exe's debug section.. this is an actual bug in telock(41c only?).. not my code, on the 4th byte, it gets the value 3daeh in eax, subs this from the destination (so esi -> 4000h bytes before the va to unpack into), then executes a repz movsb to copy 10h bytes.. in my code, esi -> 390000h .. in loader32, esi -> 480000h (while its unpacking the data at 484000h), bug was fixed by putting a buffer infront of my unpack_buffer to stop page faults

-this also affects the 'how many bytes unpacked' counter, it returns like, 1200h instead of 1473ECh, the counter is used in the pe rebuilder, for calculating raw size of unpacked section, so the odd file will have a section with the wrong raw size and garbage data inside it
